# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a dynamic Weather Forecast Analytics Dashboard built using **Microsoft Power BI**.  
It fetches real-time weather and forecast data from a Weather API and visualizes:

- 🌡️ Current weather conditions
- 📅 Daily forecast
- ⏰ Hourly forecast
- 🌍 Multi-city comparison

The dataset is automatically refreshed in Power BI Service to always display the latest available weather data.

## 🔄 Data Source

Data is fetched using a Weather API:

- API Type: REST
- Format: JSON
- Refresh Mode: Scheduled Refresh in Power BI Service

---

## 🔁 Automatic Refresh

The dataset is published to **Power BI Service** and configured with:

- Scheduled Refresh enabled
- Proper API credentials
- Time zone set to local region
- Relative date filtering to always display latest data

This ensures the dashboard updates automatically without manual intervention.
